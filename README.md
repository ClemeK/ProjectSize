This is an application to calculate the size of your project.

currently, it will work on the following file ending in:
- h (C, C++ header files)
- c (C files)
- cpp (C++ files)
- cs (C# files)
- java (Java  files)
- js (JavaScript  files)
- py (Python  files)
- xaml (WPF screen mark-Up files)

When you run the application, you can then select a project solution or a folder,

and when you select the [GO] button the application will display the files and a breakdown of the file's content (Total Lines, Blank Lines, Comment Lines, Code Line). At the bottom of the screen, you will get the totals.
